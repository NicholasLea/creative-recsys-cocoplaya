# STEP 1

The first step is to download the audio samples for the songs from Spotify, this step could be ommited if you already count with the audio, but take in to account that the mp3 files must be placed in a folder following this structure, for example: for the song spotify:track:01EADvpwhTIvFgyDAuC108:

`/audio_folder/08/01EADvpwhTIvFgyDAuC108.mp3`

To download the audio a file with the urls is required, to get this file please contact [Andres Ferraro!] (andres.ferraro@upf.edu). After uncompressing the Json file with the urls of the songs, run the python 3 script `download_audio.py`. The folder where the audio will be downloaded can be specified in the script.
